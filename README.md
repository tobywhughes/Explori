# Explori


Explori is a file explorer that seeks to make file exploration on linux systems easier and more comfortable. The vision for this software is to provide a quick and efficient method of traversing, opening, and managing files, while also providing a sleek yet completely customizable interface. These two core principles are aimed at two major sections of the linux userbase - thouse who love linux for improving their workflow and those who enjoy software that both works and is customizable to the users tastes.

Short term goals:
-Configuration files that can be used to change the look and controls of virtually everything in the Explori File Browser
-Simple commands to make file management quick and easy.
-Simple file traversal tools to help make finding files easy

Long term goals:
-Scripting: Simple scripting to allow you to make explori work even better for you, or maybe to include explori in some other project where it can be used
-"Smart" Traversal: Explori will learn where you go to get your files and will give you the option to jump to exactly where you need
-Cross Platform support: Expand the Explori File Browser to help the workflow of users on non-Linux operating systems.
